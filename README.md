## Features
---
### Individual User Message Frequency
- Measure the level of engagement for key influencers or highly active members.

### Dynamic Topic Segmentation
- Apply NLP to identify and tag ongoing topics in the chat for theme change tracking over time.

### Spam Detection
- Flag messages as probable spams due to repetitive patterns, suspicious links, or high-frequency messages from new users.

### Conversation Thread Analysis
- Identify messages that link back or respond to previous messages to understand the flow of conversations and user interactions.

### Anonymity Detection
- Score messages for probable anonymity by masking user handles or sensitive content. This would, in particular, be quite useful in privacy-focused contexts.

### Conflict Resolution Trigger
- Flag potential conflicts using aggressive keywords or escalating interactions to possibly trigger mediation or admin alerts.

### Cultural Sentiment Analysis
- Test for cultural sentiments or localized expressions through messages using advanced NLP models; this is quite essential in globally diversified groups.

### Automated Summarization
- Briefly summarize long discussions through text summarization techniques that help members who need to catch up.

### Event Detection
- Identify messages that deal only with dates, times, or announcements of events that can be used for the purposes of calendar syncing and/or notification systems.

### Compliance Monitoring
- Following up on messages that violate a group's rules or standard legal norms by means of forbidden content or behavior checking.
